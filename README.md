# Explore-Penang 🌴 
### A Frontend Web Development Project

Welcome to **Explore-Penang**, a simple but polished personal website showcasing places, maps and travel-inspiration around Penang. It also serves as a glimpse into my passion for web design and my evolving frontend skills.

## 👇 What this site is  

- A static, client-side website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** via the repository **`adm-irf.github.io/Explore-Penang`**, so anyone can access it at `https://adm-irf.github.io/Explore-Penang/`.  
- Designed to deliver a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate experience

## 🛠 Why this approach & what I learned  

I chose a plain-HTML / vanilla-CSS / JS stack for a number of reasons:  

- **Simplicity and control** — by not using heavy frameworks, I retain full control over every aspect: layout, styling, responsiveness, and structure.  
- **Fast loading and portability** — the static nature ensures quick load times and minimal hosting overhead.  
- **Low friction for hosting and maintenance** — with just HTML/CSS/JS, deployment to GitHub Pages is straightforward. In fact, GitHub Pages supports static sites directly when you push HTML/CSS/JS to a repo named `username.github.io`. 

Through building this site, I sharpened multiple skills:  

- Structuring a single-page linkage website (navigation & assets organization)  
- Writing clean, semantic HTML and organized CSS for responsive design  
- Using JavaScript to improve interactivity or dynamic behavior  
- Understanding version control and deployment via GitHub  

Also, I gained a better appreciation for user experience (UX) — building something minimal but aesthetic, thinking about readability, navigation flow, and how a site behaves across devices.

## 📂 Repo / File Layout  

A basic breakdown of the repository structure might look like:

```
/ (root)
├── index.html        ← home / landing page  
├── about.html        ← optional about / info page  
├── css/              ← custom stylesheet(s)  
│     └── styles.css  
├── js/               ← any custom JS  
│     └── main.js  
├── images/           ← assets (photos, icons, maps etc.)  
└── README.md         ← this file  
```

This structure keeps things organized and makes it easy to maintain or expand in the future (e.g. add new pages, images, sections).

## 🌟 What this site represents for me  

As someone deeply involved in coding, academic work, and personal branding — this website acts as a lightweight “home base” for my digital presence. It shows that I value clarity, performance, and thoughtful design.  

It’s also a sandbox where I can experiment with new ideas — maybe try dark-mode themes, add interactive maps, integrate with my other projects, or later rebuild parts using frameworks as I grow.

## 💬 Credits / Notes  

- Built and maintained by **“adm-irf”**.  
- Inspired by best practices for static site hosting: clean file structure, semantic HTML/CSS, minimal dependencies, and GitHub Pages deployment. The idea of using GitHub Pages for portfolios or personal sites is a simple yet powerful way to host a site for free.
- If you find bugs, want to suggest features, or want to fork it for yourself — feel free to do so.

Thanks for checking out Explore-Penang! I hope it gives a clear idea of my web-development mindset and serves as a foundation for future growth.
